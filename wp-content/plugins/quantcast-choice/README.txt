== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is GDPR? =

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive privacy regulation that will replace the current Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, with an implementation date of May 25, 2018. In April 2016, after more than four years of negotiation, the European Union approved the GDPR, with the goals of strengthening and harmonizing data protection regulation for individuals across the EU and strengthening the digital economy in the EU. The GDPR is directly applicable to member states without the need for implementing national legislation.

For more information and resources about GDPR, visit the [IAB Europeâ€™s GDPR informational website](https://www.iabeurope.eu/?s=gdpr).

= When does the GDPR come in effect? =

The GDPR will be enforceable beginning on May 25, 2018.

= To whom does the GDPR apply? =

The GDPR applies to any business, whether or not it is based in the EU, that processes the personal data of EU citizens. The GDPR applies to these businesses even if the goods or services that they offer are free.

= How does Quantcast Choice, or a Consent Management Provider (CMP) solution work? =

Quantcast, or any other IAB approved Consent Management Provider (CMP), provides publishers and advertisers with a mechanism to obtain consent, and then control which third-party vendors can request consent to track users of their websites and apps. [Read this white paper outlining the function of a CMP and the Quantcast Consent implementation](https://www.quantcast.com/resources/how-to-obtain-consumer-consent-under-gdpr/).
